# 0006. Products with categories, variants, images, and archive

**Date**: 2026-10-18
**Status**: Proposed

> **Revision (2026-10-18)**: The store moved from MongoDB + Mongoose to PostgreSQL 18 + Drizzle ORM while this spec was still unbuilt, so the spec was corrected in place. The API contract, including every acceptance criterion, is unchanged. What changed underneath:
>
> - Variants are a normalized `product_variants` table, not an embedded array. The API still sends and receives `variants` as a full array per AC-4, so clients see no difference.
> - Variant SKU uniqueness is a database guarantee: partial unique indexes on `(business_id, sku) WHERE sku IS NOT NULL` in both `products` and `product_variants`. The pre-check lookup stays for a friendly 409 body, and the duplicate-key catch is the concurrency backstop (AC-2, AC-9).
> - Case-insensitive name rules use `lower(name)` expression indexes instead of a collation index; the query applies `lower()` so it keeps matching the index (AC-7, AC-8, AC-12).
> - Ids are UUIDs, so malformed ids and cursors return 404 and 400 (AC-16) instead of a database error.
> - Foreign keys are real, so a `businesses` row must exist before catalog rows; tests and scripts seed it first.
> - Transactions are ordinary PostgreSQL transactions. No replica set is required in local development, CI, or production (AC-14).

## Summary

Sellers can create products with a name, price and category, add up to five images and an optional full variant matrix, and see stock status that is derived from counts and thresholds. Categories are a flat list per business, SKU is optional but unique per business across products and variants, and products are archived reversibly with a guarded hard delete that keeps order history intact.

## Context

The shop sells through Facebook, WhatsApp and similar channels and needs a catalog that is quick to add to yet accurate enough for orders, inventory and profit. Today the data model sketches a Product and Category but the catalog has no product API or screens, so every order flow that needs a product is blocked. Row 8 in the scope asks for products and categories with images, SKU, stock tracking, thresholds and archive, done when a seller can add products with variants and see stock status.

Forces that shape the decision are small team and Tracer Bullet delivery, strict per business isolation that already exists for customers and business, Cloudinary for file storage already in the stack, and the need to keep the add flow fast while still supporting shops that sell the same item in several sizes or colors. A weak choice here leaks variants into a separate tangle, breaks SKU uniqueness, or forces a rewrite when inventory and orders start to rely on variant stock.

## Requirements

**User stories**:

- As an owner or staff member, I want to add a product with name, price and category so that it appears in my catalog.
- As an owner or staff member, I want to define variants like size and color so that one product can cover all combinations with their own SKU, price, cost, stock and image.
- As an owner or staff member, I want to upload up to five images per product and one image per variant so that buyers see what they are ordering.
- As an owner or staff member, I want to see stock status as in stock, low or out derived from counts so that I know what needs restocking.
- As an owner or staff member, I want to search by name or SKU and filter by category and stock status so that I find a product quickly.
- As an owner or staff member, I want to archive a product and restore it later, and hard delete it only when it has never been ordered, so that history stays intact.
- As an owner or staff member, I want to manage a flat list of categories so that products stay organized.

**Acceptance criteria** (the contract, each criterion is IDed and independently checkable):

- **AC-1**: Create product requires name (1 to 120 characters after trimming), price (number at least 0), and categoryId (must reference an existing category in the same business). Optional fields are description (up to 1000 characters after trimming), sku (trimmed and uppercased, see AC-2), cost (number at least 0 when provided), stockCount (integer at least 0, default 0 for non variant products), lowStockThreshold (integer at least 0, default 5), images (array of 0 to 5 Cloudinary URLs, see AC-5). Trimming applies to all text fields. Omitted, null and blank optional text fields are stored as absent. Invalid required fields or invalid optional nonblank fields return 400 with `VALIDATION_ERROR` and `fields` naming the invalid fields. Success returns 201 with the saved product at version 1, isArchived false, archivedAt absent.
- **AC-2**: When sku is provided it is trimmed and uppercased for storage and comparison. An sku that is blank after trimming is treated as absent. A nonblank sku must be unique across all products and all variants in the same business including archived products. Create or edit that would duplicate an sku returns 409 `DUPLICATE_SKU` with body `{ error: DUPLICATE_SKU, message, existingProductId, existingVariantId (null when the clash is a product level sku), archived: boolean }`. The check applies to product level sku and to each variant sku. A concurrent race that hits the unique index is mapped to the same 409 by looking up the conflicting sku within the business. Nothing is saved on duplicate.
- **AC-3**: Categories are flat. Create category requires name (1 to 80 characters after trimming) and allows description (up to 500 characters after trimming). Name is unique per business ignoring case and after trimming. Duplicate name returns 409 `DUPLICATE_CATEGORY` with `{ error: DUPLICATE_CATEGORY, message, existingCategoryId }`. Omitted, null and blank description is stored as absent. Category id that does not exist in the business on product create or edit returns 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` with `fields: [categoryId]` and a message that the category was not found in the business. No product is saved.
- **AC-4**: Variant matrix. A product may be non variant or variant based. Field `options` is an array of 0 to 3 option names. Each option has name (1 to 30 characters after trimming, required) and values (array of 1 to 20 values, each 1 to 30 characters after trimming). Option names are unique within the product ignoring case after trimming. Values are unique within the option ignoring case after trimming. Field `variants` is an array of 0 to 50 variant rows. When options is non empty, variants must be the full cross product of option values, each variant has combination (map from option name to chosen value, exactly one entry per option, values must be from the declared values), sku (optional, same uppercasing and uniqueness as AC-2, checked per business across all product and variant skus), price (optional override, when present at least 0, when absent the product price applies), cost (optional override, when present at least 0), stockCount (integer at least 0, required per variant), imageUrl (optional string, Cloudinary URL, validated as AC-5, at most one per variant). Missing combinations, extra combinations, duplicate combinations, or variant count outside 0 to 50 returns 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR`. Non variant product must have no options and no variants and uses product level stockCount. Variant product ignores product level stockCount and its available stock is the sum of variant stockCount values (derived, not stored as a separate writable field).
- **AC-5**: Images. Product images holds up to 5 URLs. Variant imageUrl holds at most one URL per variant. Upload is via multipart form to a dedicated endpoint that forwards to Cloudinary. Server validates each file by magic bytes, allows only jpg, png and webp, and rejects files larger than 2 MB with 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` and `fields: [images]` or `fields: [image]` for a single file. MIME type from the client is not trusted. Stored URLs are Cloudinary secure URLs returned from the upload. Exceeding 5 product images on create or edit returns 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` with `fields: [images]`. Primary image in lists is the first entry of images when present.
- **AC-6**: Stock status is derived on read, never stored as a separate writable field. For a non variant product, status is out of stock when stockCount is 0, low stock when stockCount is greater than 0 and at or below lowStockThreshold, in stock otherwise. For a variant product, each variant has the same derived status using its own stockCount and the product lowStockThreshold, and the product aggregates to out of stock only when every variant is out of stock, low stock when at least one variant is low and none are in stock, in stock when at least one variant is in stock. Threshold default is 5 and is editable per product. Updating lowStockThreshold does not change stored counts, only the derived display.
- **AC-7**: Search and filters on GET /api/products. Query param q when present searches by case insensitive name prefix and by sku prefix after trimming and uppercasing q. Matching is prefix only, not contains. Filters are categoryId (exact match to an existing category in the business, invalid id returns 400), stockStatus (one of inStock, lowStock, outOfStock, derived as AC-6), includeArchived (boolean, default false, when false only products where isArchived is false are returned, when true both are returned). All filters apply together with the search as an AND. Missing or whitespace only q applies no name or sku search and lists by filters alone.
- **AC-8**: Paging on product list is cursor based like customers. Default limit 20, maximum 50, values above 50 are clamped to 50 not rejected. Sort is `lower(name)` ascending then id ascending, backed by the `(business_id, lower(name))` expression index. The opaque base64url cursor encodes last name, last id, trimmed q, effective page size, and the effective filter values for categoryId, stockStatus and includeArchived. A cursor is malformed if it is not valid base64url, does not decode to valid JSON, or is missing any required encoded field. A malformed cursor or one used with a different q or different effective page size or different filter values returns 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` with `fields: [cursor]`. The endpoint returns `{ items, nextCursor }` where nextCursor is null when no next page. Server fetches one extra row to decide nextCursor.
- **AC-9**: Edit, archive, restore and hard delete require version for optimistic concurrency. PATCH /api/products/:id accepts version (required integer) and any editable field. Omitted fields are unchanged. Text fields are trimmed and uppercased for sku before comparison or write. Null or blank optional text description clears that field, null or blank sku clears the sku. Name, price and categoryId cannot be cleared, the create validation in AC-1 and AC-3 still applies on edit. Stock and variant rules from AC-4 apply on edit, switching between non variant and variant is allowed by providing the new options and variants shape in the same PATCH. Archiving an already archived product with a matching version returns 409 `PRODUCT_ARCHIVED` before the version check. Editing an archived product returns 409 `PRODUCT_ARCHIVED` before the version check. A matching version whose trimmed values match stored values is a no op and returns the current product without writing or incrementing version. A matching version with an actual change writes once and raises version by exactly 1 in a conditional update. A stale version returns 409 `PRODUCT_CHANGED` and changes nothing. Duplicate sku including one detected by the unique index after a concurrent edit returns 409 `DUPLICATE_SKU` with the existing id and archived flag. Checks run in order business scope and existence (404 for unknown or other business id, malformed id returns 404), archived state (409 PRODUCT_ARCHIVED), version (409 PRODUCT_CHANGED), category existence (400), sku uniqueness (409 DUPLICATE_SKU), variant matrix validity (400).
- **AC-10**: Archive sets isArchived true and archivedAt to current time, hides the product from default list and search (includeArchived false), keeps the product reachable by id, and blocks edits. Restore clears isArchived and archivedAt and returns the product to default list. Both require version and follow AC-9 ordering and concurrency. Restoring a product that is not archived returns 409 `PRODUCT_NOT_ARCHIVED`.
- **AC-11**: Hard delete is DELETE /api/products/:id with required version. It is allowed only when the product is already archived and has never been referenced by an order (no order item with productId in any order in the same business, checked at application layer; future order spec may add a per variant reference check). If the product is not archived it returns 409 `PRODUCT_NOT_ARCHIVED` before version. If it has been ordered it returns 409 `PRODUCT_IN_USE` with `{ error: PRODUCT_IN_USE, message }`. On success the product row is removed and its variant rows cascade with it. Archived products that have been ordered remain archived and are not deletable.
- **AC-12**: Category management. POST /api/categories creates a category (AC-3). GET /api/categories lists categories in the business sorted by `lower(name)` ascending. PATCH /api/categories/:id renames with the same trimming and uniqueness as create and validates version like products. DELETE /api/categories/:id removes the category only when no product in the business references it including archived products. When any product references it, delete returns 409 `CATEGORY_IN_USE` with `{ error: CATEGORY_IN_USE, message, productCount }`. Malformed category id returns 404.
- **AC-13**: Every product and category query filters on the business id from request context set by requireBusinessRole. A product or category from another business returns 404, same as unknown id. Outside the business the request returns 403 from the membership check. All product and category routes require bearer token, x-business-id header, and OWNER or STAFF role, enforced by requireBusinessRole([OWNER, STAFF]) on every route in this slice.
- **AC-14**: Each archive, restore and hard delete commits exactly one audit entry atomically with the product state change in one PostgreSQL transaction. The entry stores businessId, userId, action (PRODUCT_ARCHIVED, PRODUCT_RESTORED, PRODUCT_DELETED), entityType PRODUCT, entityId, createdAt. If either write fails the request returns 500 and neither change is committed. A plain PostgreSQL server supports the transaction, so no replica set is required in local development, CI, or production. Audit entries are write once and follow the existing 365 day retention sweep.
- **AC-15**: Client timeout and retry. Client requests time out after 10 seconds with no automatic retry. After an archive, restore or hard delete timeout the client reloads the product and reconciles the returned state and version and does not assume failure. Double submit on create is safe because the second submit hits the unique sku guard when an sku is present, and when no sku is present the product is created twice only if name, price and category match but without an sku there is no dedup, so the client treats create as idempotent only when sku is provided and otherwise shows the duplicate list result.
- **AC-16**: Malformed :id for products (not a UUID) returns 404 not 400 to avoid leaking whether an id exists. limit above 50 is clamped not rejected. Empty search with no q returns all non archived products subject to filters. Personal data in products is limited to seller supplied text and is not written to application logs; audit entries store ids and action only.

## Options considered

### Option 1: Single products table with variants in a jsonb array

One products table. The product row holds jsonb arrays for options and variants and a text array for images. All variant sku uniqueness is enforced in application code with a per business lookup plus a partial unique index on the product level sku. Reads for list, search and detail touch one table.

**Pros**:

- Fewest tables and simplest reads for the MVP
- The stored row shape matches the API array shape directly, with no mapping

**Cons**:

- Variant sku uniqueness cannot be a single index because the skus live inside a jsonb array, so a concurrent race is caught only in application code, which is weaker than the guarantee AC-2 promises
- Editing one variant rewrites the whole array, and variant rows cannot carry their own foreign keys for the order and inventory slices that follow

### Option 2: Separate product_variants table with a product reference

Products table for common fields, product_variants table where each variant is its own row with productId and businessId.

**Pros**:

- Each variant sku gets its own partial unique index on (business_id, sku), so AC-2 is enforced by the database under concurrency
- Variant level stock and sku prefix search are index friendly, and later order and inventory work can reference a variant by foreign key
- A product edit writes the product and its variants in one transaction

**Cons**:

- Product detail and list join two tables
- More rows to manage and keep in sync on edit, archive and delete

### Option 3: Product with a variant matrix plus Cloudinary image rows referenced by id

Keeps variants normalized but extracts images to a separate media table with metadata.

**Pros**:

- Image metadata and reuse are easier to audit

**Cons**:

- Adds a media domain before it proves needed, Cloudinary already stores metadata
- More indirection for the simplest image task which is show the first image

## Decision

**Chosen option**: Option 2: Separate product_variants table with a product reference

The API keeps the embedded array shape from AC-4, but storage is normalized. The move to PostgreSQL flipped the trade that originally favored embedding: a partial unique index on (business_id, sku) makes variant sku uniqueness a database guarantee instead of application discipline, and Drizzle makes the product plus variants join and the transactional edit cheap. The remaining draw of Option 1 was matching the API array shape, which is a mapping concern the repository absorbs.

## Rationale

The scope wants variants in the first product slice, so the design must carry a matrix without inventing a second domain. Option 3 adds a media table that Cloudinary already covers. Option 1 is the least code, but its one real weakness is now the deciding factor: with variants inside a jsonb array, a concurrent race on a variant sku can only be caught by application code, while AC-2 promises per business uniqueness across products and variants. Option 2 turns that promise into a constraint the database enforces, keeps each variant addressable by id for the order and inventory slices that follow, and costs one join per read. The flat category choice and derived stock status keep the rules simple and reversible, and the archive plus guarded hard delete keeps order history safe while still allowing cleanup of never ordered items.

## Feature design

**Data model sketch**:

- Category (table categories)
  - businessId: uuid foreign key to businesses, required, from request context
  - name: required, 1 to 80 characters after trimming
  - description: optional, up to 500 characters after trimming, absent when omitted, null or blank
  - version: required integer, starts at 1, used by rename
  - createdAt, updatedAt: timestamptz, set by the repository
  - Indexes: unique (businessId, lower(name)) so the uniqueness check is case insensitive after trimming. Categories are flat: there is no parentId.
- Product (table products)
  - businessId: uuid foreign key to businesses, required, from request context
  - name: required, 1 to 120 characters after trimming
  - description: optional, up to 500 characters after trimming
  - categoryId: uuid foreign key to categories, required
  - sku: optional, stored trimmed and uppercased, null when omitted or blank
  - price: required, integer at least 0
  - cost: optional, integer at least 0
  - stockCount: integer at least 0, default 0, used for non variant products, ignored for variant products where available stock is the sum of variant stockCount values
  - lowStockThreshold: integer at least 0, default 5
  - images: text array of Cloudinary secure URLs, 0 to 5 entries, primary is images[0]
  - options: jsonb array of 0 to 3 entries, each { name: string 1 to 30 trimmed required, values: string[1 to 20] each 1 to 30 trimmed required }, names unique per product ignoring case after trimming, values unique per option ignoring case
  - isArchived: boolean, default false
  - archivedAt: timestamp or null, set when archived, cleared on restore
  - version: required integer, starts at 1
  - createdAt, updatedAt: timestamptz, set by the repository
  - Indexes: partial unique (businessId, sku) where sku is not null, which reserves product level skus including archived ones; (businessId, lower(name)) for name prefix search and sort; (businessId, categoryId) for the category filter; (businessId, isArchived, name) for the default list that hides archived.
- ProductVariant (table product_variants)
  - businessId: uuid foreign key to businesses, required
  - productId: uuid foreign key to products, required, on delete cascade
  - position: integer, required, unique per product. It preserves the API array order, so variants come back in the order they were sent
  - combination: jsonb map string to string, one entry per option, every value drawn from the declared values
  - sku: optional, stored trimmed and uppercased, partial unique (businessId, sku) where sku is not null, the same per business reservation as the product level sku
  - price, cost: optional integers at least 0, null means the product value applies
  - stockCount: integer at least 0, required per variant
  - imageUrl: optional Cloudinary secure URL, at most one per variant
  - createdAt, updatedAt: timestamptz, set by the repository
  - Indexes: unique (productId, position); partial unique (businessId, sku) where sku is not null
- AuditLog (existing table audit_logs): stores businessId, userId, action (PRODUCT_ARCHIVED, PRODUCT_RESTORED, PRODUCT_DELETED), entityType PRODUCT, entityId, createdAt. The existing (businessId, entityType, entityId, createdAt) index covers product actions, and the existing 365 day retention sweep applies to product audit entries as well.
- Note: order_items keeps its product_id foreign key. This spec does not change orders. Future order work may add a per variant reference and per variant ordering guards.

**State transitions**:

- Active to Archived: PATCH or POST archive with current version, sets isArchived true and archivedAt to now, raises version, writes audit entry, all in one transaction. Archived products are excluded from default list and search when includeArchived is false and cannot be edited.
- Archived to Active: restore with current version, clears isArchived and archivedAt, raises version, writes audit entry, all in one transaction.
- Archived and never ordered to Deleted: hard delete with current version, removes the product row and cascades its variants, writes audit entry, all in one transaction. Products that have been ordered remain archived and return 409 PRODUCT_IN_USE.
- Edit is allowed only while Active. Images can be added or removed while Active as part of PATCH. Switching between non variant and variant is a valid edit when the options and variants shape in the request is valid per AC-4.

**API surface**:

Successful bodies use endpoint specific payloads. Errors use { error: CODE, message: plain message }, validation errors (400) also include fields array naming the invalid fields. This continues the customer 0005 error code convention with new codes PRODUCT_CHANGED, PRODUCT_ARCHIVED, PRODUCT_NOT_ARCHIVED, PRODUCT_IN_USE, DUPLICATE_SKU, DUPLICATE_CATEGORY, CATEGORY_IN_USE. Every route requires bearer token, x-business-id header, and OWNER or STAFF role.

**Key invariants**:

- One category name per business ignoring case after trimming.
- Product name required 1 to 120 after trimming, price at least 0, categoryId required and must exist in the same business, cost at least 0 when present.
- Sku when present is stored trimmed and uppercased and is unique per business across all products and all variants including archived, enforced by partial unique indexes on (businessId, sku) in products and product_variants, with a pre-check lookup for the friendly error body and the duplicate key catch mapped to 409 DUPLICATE_SKU with existing id and archived flag.
- Options at most 3 per product, each name 1 to 30 trimmed and unique per product ignoring case, each with 1 to 20 values 1 to 30 trimmed unique per option ignoring case. Variants at most 50, combinations are exactly the cross product of option values with no missing, extra or duplicate combination, and per variant stockCount required integer at least 0.
- Variant product available stock is the sum of variant stockCount values, non variant product uses its own stockCount, neither is a writable derived column.
- Stock status is derived on read, not a writable field. Threshold default 5 integer at least 0.
- Images array holds at most 5 Cloudinary URLs, validated by magic bytes for jpg png webp and rejection over 2 MB, MIME from client is untrusted.
- Version rises by exactly 1 on each successful write that changes data, no op edit does not write or increment, stale version changes nothing and returns 409 PRODUCT_CHANGED.
- Archived products are hidden from default list and search when includeArchived is false, remain reachable by id, cannot be edited, and archiving an already archived product with matching version returns 409 PRODUCT_ARCHIVED.
- Hard delete allowed only when isArchived is true and no order item references the product in the same business, otherwise 409 PRODUCT_NOT_ARCHIVED or 409 PRODUCT_IN_USE.
- Every query filters on businessId from request context, a different business id returns 404 for a specific id and is invisible in lists, outside membership returns 403.
- Limit defaults to 20, values above 50 are clamped not rejected. Cursors are opaque base64url JSON with fields listed in AC-8. Invalid cursors or cursors reused with different q or page size or filters return 400 VALIDATION_ERROR with fields [cursor].
- Malformed product or category id that is not a UUID returns 404 not 400.

**Security model**:

- Roles OWNER and STAFF can use every product and category endpoint including create, edit, archive, restore, hard delete, and image upload. Enforced by requireBusinessRole([OWNER, STAFF]) on every route in this slice. This mirrors the customer slice and the confirmation that staff sees sensitive fields like cost.
- Outside the business the tenant guard returns 403. A product or category id from another business returns 404 same as unknown id.
- Product text and image URLs are seller supplied and not written to application logs. Audit entries store ids and action only.
- Magic byte validation and 2 MB limit on images prevent type spoofing where a text file is renamed to png, same pattern as business logo.
- Audit entries are write once, never updated or deleted by application code, retained by the 365 day retention sweep.

**Configuration required**:

- No new environment variables for this slice beyond what the stack already requires. Cloudinary credentials (CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CATEGORY, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET) already validated at startup per spec 0001. No new third party service account needed before coding.
- Catalog tables and indexes ship in `backend/drizzle/migrations` and are applied with `npm run db:migrate --workspace @f-commerce/backend`. Tests apply the same migrations to their own database automatically, and the existing partial unique sku indexes on `products` and `product_variants` already cover AC-2.

**Critical test scenarios** (each maps to an acceptance criterion in Requirements):

- Happy path: create a flat category, create a non variant product with name, price, categoryId, sku and two images, find it by name prefix and by sku prefix, verifies AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, AC-7, AC-8
- Variant happy path: create a product with two options Size with values S and M and Color with values Red and Blue, provide four variants covering every combination each with its own sku and stock, detail shows per variant derived status and product available stock as sum of variants, verifies AC-4, AC-6
- Failure case: create with a sku that already exists as a product or as a variant sku in the same business returns 409 DUPLICATE_SKU with existingProductId and archived flag and nothing is saved, concurrent create or edit race on the same sku also maps to 409 via duplicate key catch, verifies AC-2, AC-9
- Failure case: product create with unknown categoryId returns 400 with fields [categoryId], verifies AC-3
- Validation case: name longer than 120, description longer than 1000, category name longer than 80, option name longer than 30, too many options, too many variants, duplicate option name case insensitive, invalid combination, more than 5 images, image larger than 2 MB, field of wrong type for variant image, all return 400 with fields naming the invalid field, verifies AC-1, AC-3, AC-4, AC-5
- Concurrency case: two PATCH edits sent with the same version, the second returns 409 PRODUCT_CHANGED and the stored record matches the first save, no op edit with same trimmed values does not increment version, verifies AC-9
- Archive case: archive with current version sets isArchived true and hides from default list, edit while archived returns 409 PRODUCT_ARCHIVED, restore with current version clears isArchived and returns to list, archiving an already archived product returns 409 PRODUCT_ARCHIVED, verifies AC-10
- Hard delete case: hard delete of an archived product that has never been ordered succeeds and writes an audit entry, hard delete of a non archived product returns 409 PRODUCT_NOT_ARCHIVED, hard delete of an archived product that has been ordered returns 409 PRODUCT_IN_USE, verifies AC-11
- Category delete case: delete of a category that is referenced by any product including archived returns 409 CATEGORY_IN_USE, empty category deletes with 204, verifies AC-12
- Stock status case: non variant product with stockCount 0 shows out of stock, with stockCount 3 and threshold 5 shows low stock, with stockCount 10 shows in stock, variant product aggregates per AC-6, verifies AC-6
- Search and paging case: list with q matches name prefix and sku prefix case insensitive via uppercasing, categoryId filter and stockStatus filter and includeArchived filter AND together, paging defaults to 20 clamped to 50, cursor encodes filters and query, malformed or mismatched cursor returns 400 with fields [cursor], verifies AC-7, AC-8
- Auth case: STAFF can create, edit, archive, restore and hard delete, outside business gets 403, product id from another business returns 404, verifies AC-13
- Transaction case: if the audit insert fails during archive, restore or hard delete the product state and audit entry both remain unchanged, after a client timeout reloading the product reveals the committed state and version, verifies AC-14, AC-15
- Index case: name prefix search uses the (businessId, lower(name)) expression index confirmed with an explain plan in the test suite, verifies AC-7
- Image case: upload of a text file renamed to png is rejected by magic byte check, valid jpg png webp up to 2 MB is accepted and stored as Cloudinary secure URL, verifies AC-5

## Build plan

1. Confirm the data model target migration 0000 already ships the fields and indexes this slice builds on: products with archivedAt, version, images text array, options jsonb and the four indexes; product_variants with position, combination, optional sku, price, cost, stockCount and imageUrl plus its two unique indexes; categories with description and a unique (businessId, lower(name)) index. Add a new Drizzle migration only for anything missing, and record that no backfill is needed because the MongoDB catalog data was not migrated, satisfies AC-1, AC-3, AC-4, AC-8, AC-14
2. Add request and response DTOs and error codes to packages/contracts for Category and Product including DUPLICATE_SKU, DUPLICATE_CATEGORY, PRODUCT_CHANGED, PRODUCT_ARCHIVED, PRODUCT_NOT_ARCHIVED, PRODUCT_IN_USE, CATEGORY_IN_USE, VALIDATION_ERROR with fields, and add domain helpers for sku uppercasing and trimming, stock status derivation per AC-6, and variant matrix validation per AC-4, keep business rules in the domain layer, satisfies AC-1, AC-2, AC-4, AC-6, AC-9
3. Build category use cases and routes POST and GET and PATCH and DELETE with per business case insensitive uniqueness, version guard on rename like customers, and CATEGORY_IN_USE guard on delete that counts products including archived, wire every category route to requireBusinessRole([OWNER, STAFF]), satisfies AC-3, AC-12, AC-13
4. Build product create and get and list as a thin vertical thread, create validates name, price, category existence, sku uppercasing and per business uniqueness across products and variants, variant matrix validity, and image count, save at version 1 with isArchived false, list implements name and sku prefix search, category, stockStatus and includeArchived AND filters, derived stock status, and cursor paging sorted by lower(name), satisfies AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-13
5. Build image upload endpoints for product images and per variant image that validate magic bytes for jpg, png and webp and reject over 2 MB, forward valid files to Cloudinary and store the returned secure URLs, enforce at most 5 product images and at most one per variant, and block uploads when the product is archived, satisfies AC-5, AC-10
6. Build product edit PATCH with optimistic concurrency, apply the same trimming, uppercasing and validation as create, clear description and sku when null or blank, forbid clearing name, price and categoryId, enforce matrix validity and sku uniqueness including duplicate key catch mapped to 409, allow switching between non variant and variant shapes in one edit, raise version by 1 on actual change via conditional update and skip write on no op, satisfies AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-9
7. Build archive, restore and hard delete with version guard, archived state checks before version, hard delete guard that the product is already archived and has never been referenced by an order item in the same business, run the product state change and single audit write in one PostgreSQL transaction with 500 on failure and no partial commit, satisfies AC-10, AC-11, AC-14
8. Wire tenant isolation and role guard verification across all product and category routes, confirm that another business id returns 404 and outside membership returns 403, and that malformed ids return 404, satisfies AC-13, AC-16
9. Handle timeout and retry behavior at the client boundary, set 10 second timeout with no auto retry, after archive, restore or hard delete timeout reload the current product and reconcile state and version, double submit on create with an sku is safe via the DUPLICATE_SKU guard, satisfies AC-15
10. Build frontend sellers catalog screens through a thin vertical thread, category list with create and rename and delete blocked when in use, product list with search by name and sku, filters for category and stock status and include archived toggle, and cursor paging, and create form requiring name, price and category with optional description, sku, cost, stockCount, threshold, images up to 5, and variant matrix builder with up to 3 options and 50 variants each with sku, price, cost, stock and image, using the shared loading, empty and error states with their own empty messages for catalog and variants, satisfies AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-5, AC-6, AC-7, AC-8, AC-11, AC-12, AC-13
11. Build frontend product detail with derived per variant and product status, editable fields with version handling that shows PRODUCT_CHANGED and reloads, archive and restore and hard delete actions that reload after timeout, and image management with magic byte validation feedback, satisfies AC-6, AC-9, AC-10, AC-11, AC-14, AC-15

## Consequences

**Positive**:

- The catalog can cover single and variant products in one API shape without a second domain
- Seller can move quickly on create with only name, price and category required and add the rest later
- Derived stock status is always in sync with counts and thresholds with no stale stored status
- Reversible archive plus guarded hard delete keeps order history intact while still allowing cleanup
- Flat categories and prefix search keep the MVP simple and index friendly

**Negative / tradeoffs**:

- Variant sku uniqueness now has its own partial unique index per business in product_variants, so the database rules on races; the pre-check lookup only exists to build the friendly 409 body
- A product read joins products and product_variants, and a product edit writes both tables in one transaction, so writes are slightly more involved than one row
- Archive hides from default list, so a seller who expects to see archived items must use the include archived toggle, which adds a filter state to carry in the cursor

**Neutral**:

- Adds expression indexes for category and product name plus category and archive filtered indexes, and reuses the existing audit_logs index for product actions with the same 365 day retention sweep
- No data backfill: the MongoDB catalog data was not migrated, so there are no legacy product rows to set version 1 on
- No new environment variables or service accounts beyond the Cloudinary credentials already required

## Follow-up

- [ ] Row 9 (orders) must reject new orders for an archived product and may need a per variant stock check, and order items may need to snapshot the exact variant chosen with its price and sku
- [ ] Row 11 (inventory) will build transaction history on top of product stockCount or variant stockCount, so consider locking or version checks when inventory movements land
- [ ] Row 16 (search) may add contains search with a trigram or full text index if prefix search proves limiting
- [ ] Consider a partial unique index that releases an archived product sku for reuse only if product policy changes, the current spec keeps archived skus reserved so restore never collides
