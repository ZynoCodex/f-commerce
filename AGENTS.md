# F Commerce Order Manager

## Stack

- **Language and runtime**: TypeScript, Node.js 24 LTS
- **Framework**: Next.js app router, Express
- **Key dependencies**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, JWT authentication, BullMQ with Redis, Cloudinary
- **Package manager**: npm 11 with npm workspaces

## Build approach

Tracer Bullet, build each feature as a thin complete path through the database, API, and UI.

## Commands

```bash
# Install
npm ci

# Dev servers
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Test
npm run test

# Quality checks
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run format:check
```

## Specs

Stored in `docs/specs/`. Newer specs use a folder per feature: `docs/specs/NNNN-title/index.md`, with `rationale.md` and `verify.md` beside it. Earlier specs use a single `docs/specs/NNNN-title.md`.

## Deployment

Host agnostic. The frontend and the API deploy as two independent services to any Node.js 24 platform: a managed PaaS, a container host, or a plain VM, with no code change between them.

- Use no host-specific APIs, config files, build hooks, or SDKs.
- Read every host value (port, public origin, database URL, secrets, service URLs) from a validated environment variable. Never hardcode a host name.
- The browser calls the frontend origin only. The Next.js server proxies `/api/*` to `API_ORIGIN`, so no CORS and no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable is needed in production. The refresh cookie is host only and `SameSite=Strict` on that origin, so browser code must never call the API host directly; that path would need `SameSite=None`, a secure cookie, and CSRF protection.
- A host builds only the application workspace, then runs that workspace's `start` script. Each application's `prebuild` builds `packages/contracts` first, so no host runs a separate contracts build step.
- Keep `/health` unauthenticated and free of external dependencies so any platform can probe it.
- Keep background work in its own process entry point so it can run as a separate service on hosts that require it.

## Rules

- Keep the four Clean Architecture layers separate: `domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`, and `presentation`.
- Keep domain logic independent from frameworks, databases, HTTP clients, and other I/O.
- Make outer layers depend on inner layers, never the reverse.
- Keep use cases as thin orchestrators and enforce business invariants in entities.
- Use DTOs or plain objects across layer boundaries. Do not expose domain entities to presentation code.
- Use strict TypeScript. Avoid `any` and require exhaustive types.
- Organize application code by layer, with clear and consistent naming.
- Document public APIs and use one consistent error handling pattern.
- Validate environment variables at startup and use named exports only.
- Keep the UI accessible to the WCAG AA baseline.
- Use conventional commit messages.

## Tooling

- Use the standard ESLint and Prettier setup for Next.js and Express.
- Run lint, format, and typecheck before each commit.
- Use unit and integration tests.
- When a test mocks a class the code constructs with `new`, the mock implementation must be a regular function, not an arrow; Vitest constructs mock implementations.
- Run basic continuous integration checks on push for lint, typecheck, and tests.

## Git

- integration: on
- branch prefix: `feat/`
